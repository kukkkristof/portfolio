# Portfolio


## Introduction
Welcome to my portfolio, here you can find my work, and see what I am capable of

## What can you find?
Currently here only my university work can be found, all of them got a grade 5.
The projects are written in C, C#12 and C#13

## Note:
Work in progress! Currently working on a server-client bidirectional communication system for games.
This portfolio will keep expanding, so if my work does not currently seem to fit your needs,
make sure to check back later maybe then I can change your mind!

There are sone inconsistencies with the common language usage, that is because of the different needs of different professors.
I am most comfortable with English, however at one assignment (Basics of Artifical Intelligence - Genetic Algorithms) hungarian language was required.
